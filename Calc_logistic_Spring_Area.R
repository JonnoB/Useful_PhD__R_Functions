#' Logistic sprin area
#' 
#' Experimental. Calculate the spring area of an edge based on a logistic curve
#' 
#' 
#' @param g  an igraph object
#' @param Force a character string that is the name of the edge atribute that is used as force
#' @param Capacity a character string that is the ame of the edge atribute for edge capacity
#' @param eta the range of possible logistic values
#' @param gamma the minimum value the logistic function will produce
#' @param kappa the squashing parameter of the logistic function
#' 
#' @details #' This function allows for variable cross sectional area of an edge. This might be because
#' there is a complex relationship between the flow and it's physical interpretation.
#' The output of this function is a graph with an area attribute "Area".
