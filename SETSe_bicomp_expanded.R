#' Bicomponent SETS embedding expanded
#' 
#' This has been removed from rSETSe as it was experimental and too unstable. For it to be able to run SETSe probably needs to have its
#' functions loaded via source so internal functions can be called.
#' A wrapper function that takes a prepared graph and outputs a list of the embeddings and the aggregate dynamics throughout the simulations.
#' 
#' @param g An igraph object
#' @param force A character string. This is the node attribute that contains the force the nodes exert on the network.
#' @param distance A character string. The edge attribute that contains the original/horizontal distance between nodes.
#' @param edge_name A character string. This is the edge attribute that contains the edge_name of the edges.
#' @param k A character string. This is k for the moment don't change it.
#' @param tstep A numeric. The time interval used to iterate through the network dynamics.
#' @param coef_drag A numeric. This sets the multiplier of friction. Only use if you want to be annoyed and confused
#' @param tol A numeric. The tolerance factor for early stopping.
#' @param max_iter An integer. The maximum number of iterations before stopping. Larger networks usually need more iterations.
#' @param mass A numeric. This is the mass constant of the nodes in normalised networks this is set to 1.
#' @param sparse Logical. Whether sparse matrices will be used. This becomes valubale for larger networks
#' 
#' @return A list containing 3 dataframes, the dataframe of the node embeddings, edge embeddings, and network dynamics
