#' Create stabilosed blocks
#' 
#' decomposes the network into bi-connected components using articulation points. This speeds up the convergence process
#' and reduces the chances of the SETS algorithm diverging
#' 
#' @param g An igraph object
#' @param OriginBlock An Igraph object. This is created by Create_balanced_blocks function
#' @param OriginBlock_number An integer. this is the origin block chosen from the
#' create_stable_blocks function. Usually this will be the largest block.
#' @param force A character string. This is the node attribute that contains the force the nodes exert on the network.
#' @param edge_name A character string. This is the edge attribute that contains the edge_name of the edges.
#' @param tstep A numeric. The time interval used to iterate through the network dynamics.
#' @param coef_drag A numeric. This sets the multiplier of friction. Only use if you want to be annoyed and confused
#' @param tol A numeric. The tolerance factor for early stopping.
#' @param distance A character string. The edge attribute that contains the original/horizontal distance between nodes.
#' @param max_iter An integer. The maximum number of iterations before stopping. Larger networks usually need more iterations.
#' @param mass A numeric. This is the mass constant of the nodes in normalised networks this is set to 1.
#' @param verbose Logical. This value sets whether messages generated during the process are supressed or not.
#' @param sparse Logical. Whether or not the function should be run using sparse matrices. must match the actual matrix, 
#' this could prob be automated
#' 
#' @seealso \code{\link{Create_stabilised_blocks}}
#' @return A dataframe with the height embeddings of the network
