#'Make interaction network
#'
#'This is a helper function and is called by 'adjust_components' which is itself called by 'Create_stabilised_blocks_expanded' 
#'used by stabilised block, It creates a sparse adjacency matrix that has the interaction between nodes and the 
#'floor/ceiling nodes of the articulation nodes on the shortest path between the origin node in the origin 
#'component and all the other nodes in the network.
#'
#' @param target_df A dataframe... I need to check what of
#' @param node_component_df A dataframe representing the embedded nodes of a bi-conneceted component
#'
#'@details The networks created are bipartite

#'Using the relative blocks is probably not optimal this can be changed when the process works as expected
