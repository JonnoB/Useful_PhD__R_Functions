#' Calculate the youngs modulus of the spring
#' 
#' This function adds the graph characteristic E which is the youngs modulus of each edge in the graph.
#'
#' @param g an igraph object. The graph representing the network
#' @param flow a character string. The name of the edge atribute that is used as flow
#' @param capacity a character string. The ame of the edge atribute for edge capacity
#' @param minimum_value a numeric value. Indicating the most stretchy value of youngs modulus
#' @param stretch_range a numeric value. This gives the range of k values above the minimum and the point 
#' when loading is 100% of capacity
#' 
#' @details This function needs to be cleaned up for modern SETSe if it is going to be included in the package
#' It mentions "flow" which is no longer a concept that SETSe has.
#' 
#' @export
